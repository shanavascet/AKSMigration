I'll help you design a comprehensive ecosystem for your flight catering manager system. Let me break this down into the key components and recommend appropriate technologies for each layer.
Overall Architecture Overview
Your system has three main tiers:

Data Ingestion Layer → Multiple sources to Cosmos DB
API/Business Logic Layer → Spring Boot application
Data Storage Layer → PostgreSQL for operational data

Recommended Tech Stack
1. Data Ingestion to Cosmos DB
Primary Technology: Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Native Azure service with excellent Cosmos DB integration
90+ built-in connectors for various data sources
Visual pipeline designer with monitoring capabilities
Handles batch and real-time data ingestion
Cost-effective for scheduled data movements

Alternative/Complementary: Apache Kafka + Kafka Connect

For real-time streaming requirements
Kafka Connect has numerous source connectors
Can be deployed on AKS
Better for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios

For Complex Transformations: Azure Databricks

When you need heavy data processing/transformation
Supports both batch and streaming
Can write processed data to Cosmos DB

2. Data Flow: Cosmos DB → PostgreSQL
Recommended: Spring Boot with Cosmos DB SDK

Use Azure Cosmos DB Spring Boot Starter
Implement scheduled jobs or event-driven processes
Can use Change Feed for real-time sync
Custom business logic for data transformation

Alternative: Azure Logic Apps

For simple data movement without complex logic
Built-in connectors for both Cosmos DB and PostgreSQL

3. Spring Boot Application Stack
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Data JPA (for PostgreSQL)
- Spring Data Cosmos (for Cosmos DB integration)
- Spring Security (authentication/authorization)
- Spring Boot Actuator (monitoring)
- Maven/Gradle for build management
4. AKS Deployment Components
Core Services:

Ingress Controller: NGINX or Azure Application Gateway
Service Mesh: Istio (optional, for advanced traffic management)
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Secrets Management: Azure Key Vault integration

Detailed Component Design
Data Ingestion Architecture
External Sources → Azure Data Factory → Cosmos DB

              Monitoring & Alerting
Key Considerations:

Use ADF's mapping data flows for transformations
Implement data validation and error handling
Set up monitoring for failed ingestions
Use managed identity for secure connections

Spring Boot Application Architecture
AKS Cluster
├── Flight Catering Manager Service
│   ├── Controllers (REST APIs)
│   ├── Services (Business Logic)
│   ├── Repositories (Data Access)
│   └── Configuration
├── PostgreSQL (Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
└── Cosmos DB Integration
Sample Implementation Structure
Data Sync Service (Spring Boot)
java@Component
@Slf4j
public class DataSyncService {
    
    @Autowired
    private CosmosTemplate cosmosTemplate;
    
    @Autowired
    private CateringRepository cateringRepository;
    
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 300000) // 5 minutes
    public void syncData() {
        // Read from Cosmos DB
        // Transform data
        // Save to PostgreSQL
    }
}
Deployment Strategy
1. Containerization

Use multi-stage Docker builds
Implement health checks
Use Azure Container Registry (ACR)

2. AKS Configuration
yaml# Example deployment structure
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flight-catering-manager
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flight-catering-manager
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: your-acr.azurecr.io/flight-catering-manager:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: COSMOS_DB_URI
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: cosmos-secret
              key: uri
3. Infrastructure as Code

Terraform or Azure ARM Templates
Helm Charts for Kubernetes deployments
Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Security Considerations

Azure Key Vault for secrets management
Managed Identity for service-to-service authentication
Network Security Groups for network isolation
Azure Private Link for secure database connections
RBAC for Kubernetes access control

Monitoring and Observability

Azure Monitor for overall system health
Application Insights for Spring Boot application monitoring
Prometheus + Grafana for custom metrics
Centralized logging with ELK stack

Cost Optimization

Use Azure Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
Implement auto-scaling for AKS nodes
Use Azure Cost Management for monitoring
Consider Cosmos DB serverless for variable workloads

## Summary
Setup CI/CD pipelines and onboard repositories for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) migration

---

## Description

### Overview
This ticket tracks the implementation of CI/CD pipelines and repository onboarding for migrating applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). All initial setup requirements have been gathered and the DevOps checklist has been completed.

### Objective
- Establish standardized CI/CD pipelines for AKS deployments
- Onboard all identified repositories to the new pipeline structure
- Ensure proper DevOps practices and security compliance
- Enable automated deployments to AKS clusters

### Background
As part of our cloud modernization initiative, we are migrating our applications from [current infrastructure] to Azure Kubernetes Service. This requires setting up new deployment pipelines and updating our DevOps processes.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All CI/CD pipeline templates are created and tested
- [ ] Repository onboarding process is documented and standardized
- [ ] All identified repositories are successfully onboarded
- [ ] Automated builds and deployments are functional
- [ ] Security scanning and compliance checks are integrated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accessible
- [ ] Team training is completed
- [ ] Rollback procedures are tested and documented

---

## Technical Requirements

### Pipeline Requirements
- **CI/CD Tool:** Azure DevOps / Jenkins / GitLab CI
- **Container Registry:** Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- **Kubernetes Version:** 1.28.x (or latest stable)
- **Helm Version:** 3.x
- **Image Scanning:** Trivy / Aqua Security / Twistlock

### Repository Standards
- Dockerfile optimization
- Helm chart templates
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secret management via Azure Key Vault
- Branch protection policies

---

## Scope

### In Scope
1. CI/CD pipeline creation for:
   - Build stage (Docker image creation)
   - Test stage (unit, integration tests)
   - Security scanning stage
   - Push to ACR stage
   - Deploy to AKS stage (Dev/Stage/Prod)

2. Repository onboarding for:
   - [List your repositories here]
   - Microservice A
   - Microservice B
   - Frontend Application
   - API Gateway
   - [Add all repositories]

3. Infrastructure setup:
   - AKS cluster configuration
   - Namespace creation
   - RBAC setup
   - Network policies
   - Ingress controller configuration

### Out of Scope
- Application code refactoring (separate tickets)
- Database migration (tracked separately)
- Legacy system decommissioning

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Pipeline failures during migration | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing in lower environments |
| Security vulnerabilities in containers | High | Low | Automated scanning and regular updates |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Load testing and performance monitoring |
| Team knowledge gaps | Medium | High | Training sessions and documentation |
| Integration issues | High | Medium | Phased rollout approach |
